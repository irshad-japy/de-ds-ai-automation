Let's compare Pakistan's missiles with Israel's missiles and see if they can actually hit each other or not.
Israel's missile power starts with Jericho 1, with a range of around 500 kilometers.
Then comes Jericho 2, reaching 3500 kilometers.
Enough to strike Iran or Egypt if needed.
And finally, the Jericho 3, with a range of 11,500 plus kilometers.
That means Israel can easily target Iran and Pakistan.
Let's move to Pakistani missiles.
Its missile power begins with Shaheen 1, with a solid range of 750 kilometers.
Then comes Shaheen 2, almost 1500 kilometers, matching Jericho 2 in power.
And the Shaheen 3, with a massive range of 2,700 kilometers, easily reaching and hitting Israel.
But many experts believe Pakistan secretly has even longer range missiles, hidden from the world.
