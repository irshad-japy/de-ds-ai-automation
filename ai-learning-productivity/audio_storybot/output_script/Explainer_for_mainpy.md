# Generated Script

**Hook**
Imagine you're designing a house for your family. You need to ensure that every room has enough natural light.

**Cast**
Meet the main characters:
* `parser`: the one who reads the blueprint (file)
* `LightingRequirements`: an expert who knows how much light each room needs
* `RoomAllocator`: a master builder who decides where to place rooms

**Plot**
The code solves the problem of allocating rooms in a house based on their lighting requirements.

**Scenes**

[ Footsteps fade in ]
You're walking through a blueprint file, which is like a map of your house. The parser reads it line by line [ keyboard clack ]. It encounters a section about Room A and its lighting needs. The LightingRequirements expert says, "Ah, Room A requires 500 lux."

The parser shares this information with the RoomAllocator, who decides where to place Room A in the blueprint. But there's a problem – another room, Room B, also needs 500 lux. The allocator must carefully plan the layout [ pause ].

**Twist**
What if there's no space for both rooms? Or what if the lighting requirements are too high? The code anticipates these edge cases and adjusts accordingly.

**Moral**

• Use a parser to read and understand your data.
• Consult experts (like LightingRequirements) for specific needs.
• Master builders (like RoomAllocator) make informed decisions based on the data.

• Be mindful of edge cases and adjust your plan accordingly.

• A good builder always double-checks their work!
