**Hook**
Imagine you're on a mission to automate your friend's photo gallery, where you want to display their favorite pictures from various social media platforms.

**Cast**
Meet `SocialGallery` (our main character), which will fetch photos from different sources, like Facebook and Instagram. We also have `PhotoFetcher`, responsible for retrieving images, and `ImageProcessor`, handling the image resizing and formatting.

**Plot**
Our goal is to build a gallery that can display these social media photos in a nice, organized layout.

**Scenes**

1. [Keyboard clack] You initialize the `SocialGallery` instance with API keys from Facebook and Instagram.
2. The `PhotoFetcher` character uses these APIs to fetch photos from each platform. Let's say it gets 5 photos from Facebook and 3 from Instagram.
3. [Pause] Next, we pass these fetched images to the `ImageProcessor`. It resizes them to fit our gallery layout and prepares them for display.
4. Finally, our `SocialGallery` instance uses the processed images to create a visually appealing layout.

**Twist**
Be aware of potential issues: if API keys are invalid or expired, the photos won't fetch properly; also, image resizing might consume significant resources, so optimize it accordingly!

**Moral**

• Use third-party APIs wisely and always check their documentation.
• Be mindful of system resources when handling large images.
• Keep your code modular by separating concerns into different functions/classes.
